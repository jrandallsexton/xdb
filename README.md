Quite simply, it is an object datastore, operating on OOP principals, dynamically creating code, responding to its own internal metadata and generating code where it makes sense.  Essentially XDB is (will be) an object-oriented framework that can operate dynamically and also periodically compile code based from that metadata, deploy that code into itself and continue to operate on changes to metadata within itself - no matter the current level of compilation.

XDB, for me, is meant to make my life (and other devs' lives) a much better place to be.

More forthcoming;  I've got to get this out of my head and finally into a solid project.
